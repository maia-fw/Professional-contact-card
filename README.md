I started learning to code in Feb 2023, and as a beginner I want to work on a simple and easy project with HTML & CSS. I will be adding to it slowly, but surely as I learn more and more. So far, I have already learned so much by this seemlingly small project and I'm looking forward to add to it and learn more and as I grow.
